class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(b) 	In considering whether interest is excessive under this section, the Court shall taken into account any amount charged or paid, whether in money or in kind, for expenses, inquiries, fines, bonuses, premia, renewals or any other charges, and if compound interest is charged, the periods at which it is calculated and the total advantage which may reasonably be taken to have been expected from the transaction.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(c) 	In considering the question of risk, the Court shall take into account the presence or absence of security and the value thereof, the financial condition of the debtor and the result of any previous transactions of the debtor, by way of loan, so far as the same were known, or must be taken to have been known, to the creditor.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(d) 	In considering whether a transaction was substantially unfair, the Court shall take into account all circumstances materially affecting the relations of the parties at the time of the loan or tending to show that the transaction was unfair, including the necessities or supposed necessities of the debtor at the time of the loan so far as the same were known, or must be taken to have been known, to the creditor.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	Explanation – Interest may of itself be sufficient evidence that the transaction was substantially unfair.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(3) 	This section shall apply to any suit, whatever its form may be, if such suit is substantially one for the recovery of a loan or for the enforcement of any agreement of security in respect of a loan or for the redemption of any such security.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(4) 	Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of any transferee for value who satisfies the Court that the transfer to him was bona fide, and that he had at the time of such transfer no notice of any fact which would have entitled the debtor as against the lender to relief under this section.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	For the purposes of this sub-section, the word "notice" shall have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in section 4 of the <a title='Transfer of Property Act, 1882' href='/act-48.html'>Transfer of Property Act, 1882</a>.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(5) 	Nothing in this section shall be construed as derogating from the existing powers or jurisdiction of any Court.
