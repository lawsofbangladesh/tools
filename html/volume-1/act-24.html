                    <p>21. Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them, or his representative in interest; but they can not be proved by or on behalf of the person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following cases:&ndash;</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(1) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third persons under section 32.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(2) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it consists of statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is a accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(3) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Illustrations</p>

<p>(a) The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that the deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. A may prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under section 32, clause (2).</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Chittagong.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>He produces a letter written by himself and dated at <span class='footnote'  title='The word "Dhaka" was substituted, for the word "Lahore" by section 3 and 2nd Schedule of the Bangladesh Laws (Revision and Declaration) Act, 1973 (Act No. VIII of 1973).'><span class='word-formet'><sup class='en'><a href='1' >14</a></sup></span></span>[Dhaka] on that day and bearing the <span class='footnote'  title='The word "Dhaka" was substituted, for the word "Lahore" by section 3 and 2nd Schedule of the Bangladesh Laws (Revision and Declaration) Act, 1973 (Act No. VIII of 1973).'><span class='word-formet'><sup class='en'><a href='2' >15</a></sup></span></span>[Dhaka] post-mark of that day.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead it would be admissible under section 32, clause (2).</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit coin which he knew to be counterfeit.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the coin as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that that person did examine it and told him it was genuine.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A may prove these facts for the reasons stated in the last preceding illustration.</p>

The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trail or reversal of any decision in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
