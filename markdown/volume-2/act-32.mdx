### Notice to zamindar when provisional apportionment made summarily

32. Whenever any provisional apportionment of the sum payable between the zamindars and the tenure-holders may have been made summarily, as provided in the last preceding section,the notice to be served on the zamindar under section 25 shall inform the zaminder, in addition to the particulars specified in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the said section, and instead of those specified in clauses (e) and (f),that under this Act he is entitled to recover a portion of the amount which shall be finally apportioned as payable in respect of his estate under section 26 from the tenure-holders on his estate; andthat the Collector has made a provisional apportionment of the said sum between the zamindar and tenure-holders according to a list which shall be annexed to the said notice;and shall warn him-that if he fails to prefer any objection to such provisional apportionment on or before the date specified, he will be deemed to have given up all right to prefer any such objection at any future time; andthat the Collector will proceed to make such apportionment final, or to make any modifications in it which he may think fit:Provided that the sum finally made payable by the zamindar shall not exceed the sum apportioned upon him in the said provisional apportionment between the zamindars and the tenure-holders.

### Procedure on provisional apportionment

33. As soon as a provisional apportionment between the zamindar and the tenure-holders shall have been made summarily as provided in section 31, the Collector shall proceed to serve notices on the tenure-holders concerned in the manner provided in section 30, and to do all other things as if the said provisional apportionment upon tenure-holders had been made on a list given in by the zamindar under section 30.

### Mode of apportionment among tenures

34. In apportioning the amount among the zamindars and the tenure-holders the Collector shall first deduct such sum as he shall consider to be fairly payable by the zamindar in respect of lands not included in any tenure, and respect of his interest in lands which are included in tenures; and in apportioning the remainder among the tenures he shall take into consideration the number of pillars erected within or on the boundary of each tenure, the extent of each tenure, and the distance at which it is situated from the boundary-marks; but no tenure shall be made liable for any portion of the sum so apportioned, unless some part of it be situated within fifteen hundred feet from some boundary-mark.

### Notice of apportionment in respect of tenures

35. So soon as the final apportionment among tenure-holders under section 30 shall be completed, the Collector shall cause to be issued notices to each of the said tenure-holders stating the amount payable in respect of each of their tenures, with interest (if any ) calculated at the annual rate of six per centum from the date on which the zamindar paid to the Collector the sum which was apportioned on his estate under section 26, and the cost of serving upon the tenure-holder the notice under this section and calling upon him to pay the total amount so due to the zamindar of the estate of which the tenure is a part, within one month of the date of the notice:

### No separate notice to tenure-holder required to pay less than two taka

Provided that no separate notice shall be served under this section on any tenure-holder who is required to pay a sum of less than two taka as his share of the expenses apportioned under this Act; but in respect of such sums it shall be sufficient to publish a list in the manner prescribed by section 30, and no costs incurred in respect of publication of any such list shall be recoverable from any person mentioned therein as liable to pay less than two taka.

### Collector not to issue notices to tenure-holders until zamindars have deposited costs

36. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 35, the Collector shall not issue the notices therein mentioned to the tenure-holders until the zamindars concerned shall have deposited with the Collector the full amount of the costs of serving all the notices, and of publishing the lists as required by that section.

### Apportionment between tenure-holder and holder of subordinate tenure

37. The provisions of sections 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34 and 35 shall be applicable, as far as possible, to every case in which any tenure-holder who has been made liable for the payment of any share of expenses under this Act may apply to the Collector to apportion the amount for which he has been made liable between himself and the holders of subordinate tenures direct from himself;and the provisions of sections 31, 32 and 33, regarding the procedure for making a provisional apportionment in a summary way between a zamindar and the tenure-holder on his estate, shall be applicable, as far as possible, to the provisional apportionment of expenses between the holder of a tenure and the holders of under-tenures within his tenure:Provided always that no such apportionment shall be made in respect of raiyats who have a right of occupancy only, and whose rent is not fixed in perpetuity.

### Recovery of sum payable to zamindars or tenure-holder

38. Every zamindar or tenure-holder to whom any sum is payable under the preceding sections may recover the same with interest as aforesaid in the manner provided by any law for the time being in force for the recovery of arrears of rent in respect of the tenure for which the sum is due.
