### Registration to be in respect of particular goods

5. (1) A trade mark may be registered only in respect of particular goods or classes of goods.(2) Any question arising as to the class within which any goods fall shall be determined by the Registrar whose decision in the matter shall be final.

### Distinctiveness requisite for registration

6. (1) A trade mark shall not be registered unless it contains or consists of at least one of the following essential particulars, namely:-(a) the name of a company, individual, or firm, represented in a special or particular manner;(b) the signature of the applicant for registration or some predecessor in his business;(c) one or more invented words;(d) one or more words having no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, and not being according to its ordinary signification, a geographical name or surname or the name of a sect, caste or tribe in Bangladesh;(e) any other distinctive mark, provided that a name, signature, or any word, other than such as fall within the descriptions in the above clauses, shall not be registrable except upon evidence of its distinctiveness.(2) For the purposes of this section, the expression “distinctive” means adapted, in relation to the goods in respect of which a trade mark is proposed to be registered, to distinguish goods with which the proprietor of the trade mark is or may be con┬¼nected in the course of trade from goods in the case of which no such connection subsists, either generally or, where the trade mark is proposed to be registered subject to limitations, in rela┬¼tion to use within the extent of the registration.(3) In determining whether a trade mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid, the tribunal may have regard to the extent to which┬¼-(a) the trade mark is inherently so adapted to distinguish, and(b) by reason of the use of the trade mark or of any other circumstances, the trade mark is in fact so adapted to distinguish:Provided that in the case of a trade mark which has been con┬¼tinuously used (either by the applicant for registration or by some predecessor in his business, and either in its original form or with additions or alterations not substantially affecting its identity) in relation to the same goods as those in relation to which registra┬¼tion is applied for, during a period from a date prior to the 25th day of February, 1937, to the date of application for registration, the Registrar shall not refuse registration by reason only of the fact that the trade mark is not adapted to distinguish as afore┬¼said, and may accept evidence of acquired distinctiveness as entitling the trade mark to registration.

### Limitation as to colour

7. (1) A trade mark may be limited wholly or in part to one or more specified colours, and any such limitation shall be taken into consideration by any tribunal having to decide on the distinctive character of the trade mark.(2) So far as a trade mark is registered without limitation of colour it shall be deemed to be registered for all colours.

### Prohibition of registration of certain matter

8. No trade mark nor part of a trade mark shall be registered which consists of, or contains, any scandalous design, or any matter the use of which would-(a) by reason of its being likely to deceive or to cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a Court of justice; or(b) be likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class of the citizens of Bangladesh; or(c) be contrary to any law for the time being in force or to morality.

### Use of names of chemical elements barred

9. No word which is the commonly used and accepted name of any single chemical element or single chemical compound (as distinguished from a mixture) shall be registered as a trade mark in respect of a chemical substance or preparation, and any such registration shall, notwithstanding anything in section 24, be deemed for the purposes of section 46 to be an entry made in the register without sufficient cause or an entry wrongly remaining on the register, as the circumstances may require:Provided that this section shall not apply to a word which is used to denote only a brand or make of the element or compound as made by the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark, as distinguished from the element or compound as made by others, and in association with a suitable name or description open to the public use.

### Prohibition of registration of identical or similar trade mark

10. (1) Save as provided in sub section (2), no trade mark shall be registered in respect of any goods or description of goods which is identical with a trade mark belonging to a different proprietor and [7](1)[already on the register] in respect of the same goods or description of goods or which so nearly resembles such trade mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.(2) In case of honest concurrent use or of other special circumstances which, in the opinion of the Registrar, make it proper so to do he may permit the registration by more than one proprietor of trade marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other in respect of the same goods or description of goods, subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, as the Registrar may think fit to impose.(3) Where separate applications are made by different persons to be registered as proprietors respectively of trade marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other, in respect of the same goods or description of goods, the Registrar may refuse to register any of them until their rights have been determined by a competent Court.

### Registration of parts of trade marks and of trade marks as a series

11. (1) Where the proprietor of a trade mark claims to be entitled to the exclusive use of any part thereof separately, he may apply to register the whole and the part as separate trade marks.(2) Each such separate trade mark shall satisfy all the conditions applying to, and have all the incidents of, an independent trade mark.(3) Where a person claiming to be the proprietor of several trade marks in respect of the same goods or description of goods which, while resembling each other in the material particulars thereof, yet differ in respect of-(a) statements of the goods in relation to which they are respectively used or proposed to be used; or(b) statements of number, price, quality, or names of places; or(c) other matter of a non-distinctive character which does not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark; or(d) colour;seeks to register those trade marks, they may be registered as a series in one registration.

### Associated trade marks

12. (1) Where a trade mark which is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in respect of any goods is identical with another trade mark which is registered, or is the subject of an application for registration, in the name of the same proprietor in respect of the same goods or description of goods, or so nearly resembles it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion if used by a person other than the proprietor, the Registrar may at any time require that the trade marks shall be entered on the register as associated trade marks.(2) Where a trade mark and any part thereof are, in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 11, registered as separate trade marks in the name of the same proprietor, they shall be deemed to be, and shall be registered as, associated trade marks.(3) All trade marks registered in accordance with the provisions of sub section (3) of section 11 as a series in one registration shall be deemed to be, and shall be registered as, associated trade marks.(4) On application made in the prescribed manner by the registered proprietor of two or more trade marks registered as associated trade marks, the Registrar may dissolve the association as respects any of them if he is satisfied that therewould be no likelihood of deception or confusion being caused if that trade mark were used by any other person in relation to any of the goods in respect of which it is registered, and may amend the register accordingly.

### Registration subject to disclaimer

13. If a trade mark contains┬¼-(a) any part not separately registered as a trade mark in the name of the proprietor, or for the separate registration of which no application has been made, or(b) any matter common to the trade, or otherwise of a non-distinctive character,the tribunal, in deciding whether the trade mark shall be entered or shall remain on the register, may require, as a condition of its being on the register, that the proprietor shall either disclaim any right to the exclusive use of such part or of all or any portion of such matter, as the case may be, to the exclusive use of which the tribunal holds him not to be entitled, or make such other disclaimer as the tribunal may consider necessary for the purpose of defining the rights of the proprietor under the registration:Provided that no disclaimer shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made.

### Application for registration

14. (1) Any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him who is desirous of registering it shall apply in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner, and subject to the provisions of this Act, the Registrar may refuse the application or may accept it absolutely or subject to such amendments, modifications, conditions or limitations, if any, as he may think fit.(2) In the case of a refusal or conditional acceptance the Registrar shall, if required by the applicant, state in writing the grounds of his decision and the materials used by him in arriving thereat.(3) The tribunal may at any time, whether before or after acceptance, correct any error in or in connection with the application, or may permit the applicant to amend his application upon such terms as it may think fit.

### Opposition to registration

15. (1) When an application for registration of a trade mark has been accepted, whether absolutely or subject to conditions or limitations, the Registrar shall, as soon as may be after acceptance, cause the application as accepted, together with the conditions and limitations, if any, subject to which it has been accepted, to be advertised in the prescribed manner:Provided that the Registrar may cause an application to be advertised before acceptance if it relates to a trade mark to which clause (e) of sub section (1) of section 6 applies, or in any other case where it appears to him that it is expedient by reason of any exceptional circumstances so to do, and where an application has been so advertised the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, advertise it again when it has been accepted, but shall not be bound so to do.(2) Any person may, within the prescribed time from the date of the advertisement of an application, give notice in writing in the prescribed manner to the Registrar of opposition to the registration.(3) The Registrar shall serve in the prescribed manner a copy of the notice on the applicant, and within the prescribed time the applicant shall send to the Registrar, in the prescribed manner, a counter statement of the grounds on which he relies for his application, and, if he does not do so, he shall be deemed to have abandoned his application.(4) If the applicant sends such counter statement, the Registrar shall serve in the prescribed manner a copy thereof on the persons giving notice of opposition, and shall, after hearing the parties, if so required, and considering the evidence, decide whether, and subject to what conditions or limitations, if any, registration is to be permitted.(5) If a person giving notice of opposition or an applicant sending a counter statement after receipt of a copy of such notice, or an appellant against an order of the Registrar under section 14 or this section, neither resides nor carries on business in Bangladesh, the tribunal may require him to give security for costs of the proceedings before it, and in default of such security being duly given may treat the opposition or application or appeal, as the case may be, as abandoned.

### Registration

16. (1) When an application for registration of a trade mark has been accepted and either has not been opposed and the time for notice of opposition has expired, or having been opposed, has been decided in favour of the applicant, the Registrar shall, unless the application has been accepted in error, or unless the Government otherwise directs, register the said trade mark, and the trade mark, when registered, shall be registered as of the date of the making of the said application, and that date shall, subject to any directions made under section 83 applicable to such trade mark, be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the date of registration.(2) On the registration of a trade mark the Registrar shall issue to the applicant a certificate in the prescribed form of the registration thereof sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.(3) Where registration of a trade mark is not completed within twelve months from the date of the application by reason of default on the part of the applicant, the Registrar may, after giving notice to the applicant in the prescribed manner, treat the application as abandoned unless it is completed within the time specified in that behalf in the notice.

### Jointly owned trade marks

17. (1) Save as provided in sub section (2), nothing in this Act shall authorise the registration of two or more persons who use a trade mark independently, or propose so to use it, as joint proprietors thereof.(2) Where the relations between two or more persons interested in a trade mark are such that no one of them is entitled as between himself and the other or others of them to use it except-(a) on behalf of both or all of them, or(b) in relation to an article with which both or all of them are connected in the course of trade,those persons may be registered as joint proprietors of the trade mark, and this Act shall have effect in relation to any rights to the use of the trade mark vested in those persons as if those rights had been vested in a single person.

### Duration and renewal of registration

18. (1) The registration of a trade mark shall be for a period of seven years, but may be renewed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this section.(2) The Registrar shall, on application made by the registered proprietor of a trade mark in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period, renew the registration of the trade mark for a period of fifteen years from the date of expiration of the original registration or of the last renewal of registration, as the case may be (which date is in this section referred to as “the expiration of the last registration”).(3) At the prescribed time before the expiration of the last registration of a trade mark, the Registrar shall send notice in the prescribed manner to the registered proprietor of the date of expiration and the conditions as to payment of fees and otherwise upon which a renewal of registration may be obtained, and if at the expiration of the time prescribed in that behalf those conditions have not been duly complied with, the Registrar may remove the trade mark from the register, subject to such conditions (if any) as to its restoration to the register as may be prescribed.

### Effect of removal from register for failure to pay fee for renewal

19. Where a trade mark has been removed from the register under this Act [8](1)[\* \* \*] for failure to pay the fee for renewal, it shall nevertheless, for the purpose of any application for the registration of another trade mark during one year next after the date of the removal, be deemed to be a trade mark already on the register, unless the tribunal is satisfied either-(a) that there has been no bona fide trade use of the trade mark which has been removed during the two years immediately preceding its removal; or(b) that no deception or confusion would be likely to arise from the use of the trade mark which is the subject of the application for registration by reason of any previous use of the trade mark which has been removed.

### No action for infringement of unregistered trade mark

20. (1) No person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent, or to recover damages for, the infringement of an unregistered trade mark unless such trade mark has been continuously in use since before the 25th day of February, 1937, by such person or by a predecessor in title of his and unless an application for its registration, made within five years from the commencement of this Act, has been refused; and the Registrar shall, on application in the prescribed manner, grant a certificate that such application has been refused.(2) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect rights of action against any person for passing off goods as the goods of another person or the remedies in respect thereof.

### Right conferred by registration

21. [9](1)[\* \* \*] Subject to the provisions of sections 22, 25 and 26, the registration of a person in the register as proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods shall give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generality of the fore┬¼going provision, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either-(a) as being used as a trade mark; or(b) to import a reference to some person having the right either as a proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such a person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.(2) [Omitted by section 3 and the Second Schedule of the [Bangladesh Laws (Revision And Declaration) Act, 1973](/act-430.html "Bangladesh Laws (Revision And Declaration) Act, 1973") (Act No. VIII of 1973).]

### No infringement in certain circumstances

22. (1) The right to the use of a trade mark given under section 21 by registration shall be subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register, and shall not be deemed to be infringed by the use of any such mark as aforesaid in any mode, in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise traded in, in any place, or in relation to goods to be exported to any market, or in any other circumstances, to which, having regard to any such limitations the registration does not extend.(2) The said right to the use of a trade mark shall not be deemed to be infringed by the use of any such mark as aforesaid by any person-(a) in relation to goods connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk of which they form part, the proprietor or the registered user conforming to the permitted use has applied the trade mark and has not subsequently removed or obliterated it, or has at any time expressly or impliedly consented to the use of the trade mark; or(b) in relation to goods adapted to form part of, or to be accessory to, other goods in relation to which the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given as aforesaid or might for the time being be so used, if the use of the mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods are so adapted and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the mark is to indicate otherwise than in accordance with the fact a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods.(3) The use of a registered trade mark, being one of two or more trade marks registered under this Act [10](1)[\* \* \*] which are identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration as aforesaid, shall not be deemed to be an infringement of the right so given to the use of any other of those trade marks.

### Registration to be prima facie evidence of validity

23. In all legal proceedings relating to a trade mark registered under this Act [11](1)[\* \* \*] the fact that a person is registered as proprietor thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions thereof.

### Registration to be conclusive as to validity after seven years

24. In all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark, the original registration of the trade mark shall after the expiration of seven years from the date of such original registration be taken to be valid in all respects unless such registration was obtained by fraud, or unless the trade mark offends against the provisions of section 8.

### Saving for vested rights

25. Nothing in this Act, shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior-(a) to the use of the first mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods by the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his, or(b) to the registration of the first mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods in the name of the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his,whichever is the earlier, or to object (on such use being proved) to registration of that identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under sub section (2) of section 10.

### Saving for use of name, address, or description of goods

26. No registration of a trade mark shall interfere with any bona fide use by a person of his own name or that of his place of business, or of the name, or of the name of the place of business, of any of his predecessors in business, or the use by any person of any bona fide description of the character or quality of his goods, not being a description that would be likely to be taken as importing any such reference as is mentioned in clause (b) of section 21 or in clause (b) of section 57.

### Words used as name or description of an article or substance

27. (1) The registration of a trade mark shall not be deemed to have become invalid by reason only of any use after the date of the registration of any words which the trade mark contains or of which it consists as the name or description of an article or substance:Provided that, if it is proved either-(a) that there is a well known and established use of the said words as the name or description of the article or substance by a person or persons carrying on a trade therein, not being use in relation to goods connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark or (in the case of a certification trade mark) goods certified by the proprietor; or(b) that the article or substance has been manufactured under a patent in force at or granted after the commencement of this section, that a period of two years or more after the cesser of the patent has elapsed, and that the said words are the only practicable name or description of the article or substance,-the provisions of sub section (2) shall apply.(2) Where the facts mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b) of the proviso to sub section (1) are proved with respect to any words, then-(a) for the purposes of any proceedings under section 46-(i) if the trade mark consists solely of such words, the registration of the trade mark, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question or of any goods of the same description, shall be deemed to be an entry wrongly remaining on the register;(ii) if the trade mark contains such words and other matter, the tribunal, in deciding whether the trade mark shall remain on the register, so far as regards registration in respect of the article or substance in question and of any goods of the same description, may, in case of a decision in favour of its remaining on the register, require as a condition thereof that the proprietor shall disclaim any right to the exclusive use in relation to that article or substance and any goods of the same description, of such words, provided that no disclaimer shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made;(b) for the purposes of any other legal proceedings relating to the trade mark,-(i) if the trade mark consists solely of such words, all rights of the proprietor under this Act or any other law to the exclusive use of the trade mark in relation to the article or substance in question or to any goods of the same description, or(ii) if the trade mark contains such words and other matter, all such rights of the proprietor to the exclusive use of such words, in such relation as aforesaid,shall be deemed to have ceased on the date at which the use men┬¼tioned in clause (a) of the proviso to sub section (1) first became well known and established, or at the expiration of the period of two years mentioned in clause (b) of the said proviso.

### Power of registered proprietor to assign and give receipts

28. The person for the time being entered in the register as proprietor of a trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Act and to any rights appearing from the register to be vested in any other person, have power to assign the trade mark, and to give effectual receipts for any consideration for such assignment.

### Assignability of registered trade marks

29. Notwithstanding anything in any other law to the contrary, a registered trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, be assignable and transmissible whether in connection with the goodwill of a business or not, and in respect either of all of the goods in respect of which it is registered or of some only of those goods.

### Assignability of unregistered trade marks

30. An unregistered trade mark shall be assignable and transmissible whether in connection with the goodwill of a business or not:Provided that, except in connection with the goodwill of a business, assignment or transmission shall be permissible only if┬¼-(a) at the time of assignment or transmission of the un┬¼registered trade mark it is used in the same business as a registered trade mark, and(b) the registered trade mark is assigned or transmitted at the same time and to the same person as the un┬¼registered trade mark, and(c) the unregistered trade mark relates to goods in respect of which the registered trade mark is assigned or transmitted.

### Restrictions on assignment or transmission where multiple exclusive rights would be created

31. (1) Notwithstanding anything in sections 29 and 30, a trade mark shall not be assignable or transmissible in a case in which as a result of the assignment or transmission there would in the circumstances subsist, whether under this Act or any other law, exclusive rights in more than one of the persons concerned to the use, in relation to the same goods ordescription of goods, of trade marks nearly resembling each other or of identical trade marks, if, having regard to the si┬¼milarity of the goods and of the trade marks, the use of the trade marks in exercise of those rights would be likely to deceive or cause confusion:Provided that an assignment or transmission shall not be deemed to be invalid under this sub section if the exclusive rights subsisting as a result thereof in the persons concerned respectively are, having regard to limitations imposed thereon, such as not to be exercisable by two or more of those persons in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, within Bangladesh (otherwise than for export therefrom), or in relation to goods to be exported to the same market outside Bangladesh.(2) The proprietor of a registered trade mark who proposes to assign it may submit to the Registrar in the prescribed manner a statement of case setting out the circumstances and the Registrar may issue to him a certificate stating whether, having regard to the similarity of the goods and of the trade marks referred to in the case, the proposed assignment would or would not be invalid under sub section (1), and a certificate so issued shall, subject to appeal and unless it is shown that the certificate was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, be conclusive as to the validity or invalidity under sub section (1) of the assignment in so far as such validity or invalidity depends upon the facts set out in the case, but, as regards a certificate in favour of validity, only if application for the registration under section 35 of the title of the person becoming entitled is made within six months from the date on which the certificate is issued.

### Restrictions on assignment or transmission when exclusive rights would be created in different parts of Bangladesh

32. Notwithstanding anything in sections 29 and 30, a trade mark shall not be assignable or transmissible in a case in which as a result of the assignment or transmission there would in the circumstances subsist whether under this Act or any other law, an exclusive right in one of the persons concerned to the use of the trade mark limited to use in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in any place in Bangladesh and an exclusive right in another of these persons to the use of a trade mark nearly resembling the first mentioned trade mark or of an identical trade mark in relation to the same goods or description of goods limited to use in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in any other place in Bangladesh:Provided that in any such case, on application in the prescribed manner by the proprietor of a trade mark who proposes to assign it, or by a person who claims that a registered trade mark has been transmitted to him or to a predecessor in title of his since the commencement of this Act, the Registrar, if he is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the trade mark in exercise of the said rights would not be contrary to the public interest, may approve the assignment or transmission, and an assignment or transmission so approved shall not, unless it is shown that the approval was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, be deemed to be invalid under this section or section 31 if application for the registration under section 35 of the title of the person becoming entitled is made within six months from the date on which the approval is given or, in the case of a transmission, was made before that date.

### Conditions for assignment otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of a business

33. Where an assignment in respect of any goods of a trade mark which is at the time of the assignment used in a business in those goods, is made after the commencement of this Act otherwise than in connection with the goodwill of that business, the assignment shall not take effect unless the assignee, not later than the expiration of six months from the date on which the assignment is made or within such extended period, if any, as the Registrar may allow, applies to the Registrar for directions with respect to the advertisement of the assignment, and advertises it in such form and manner and within such period as the Registrar may direct.

36. (1) No application for the registration of a trademark in respect of any goods shall be refused, nor shall permission for such registration be withheld, on the ground only that it appears that the applicant does not use or propose to use the trade mark, if the Registrar is satisfied that a company is about to be formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1913 and that the applicant intends to assign the trade mark to that company with a view to the use thereof in relation to those goods by the company.(2) The tribunal may, in a case to which sub section (1) applies, require the applicant to give security for the costs of any proceed┬¼ings relative to any opposition or appeal, and in default of such security being duly given may treat the application as abandoned.(3) Where in a case to which sub section (1) applies, a trade mark in respect of any goods is registered in the name of an applicant who relies on intention to assign to a company, then, unless within such period as may be prescribed, or within such further period not exceeding six months as the Registrar may, on application being made to him in the prescribed manner, allow, the company has been registered as the proprietor of the trade mark in respect of those goods, the registration shall cease to have effect in respect thereof at the expiration of that period, and the Registrar shall amend the register accordingly.

### Defensive registration of well known trade marks

38. (1) Where a trade mark consisting of any invented word has become so well known as respects any goods in relation to which it is registered and has been used, that the use thereof in relation to other goods would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade between those goods and a person entitled to use the trade mark in relation to the first-mentioned goods, then, notwithstanding that the proprietor registered in respect of the first mentioned goods does not use or propose to use the trade mark in relation to those other goods and notwithstanding anything in section 37, the trade mark may on application in the prescribed manner by such proprietor be registered in his name in respect of those other goods as a defensive trade mark and, while so registered, shall not be liable to be taken off the register in respect of those goods under the said section.(2) The registered proprietor of a trade mark may apply for the registration thereof in respect of any goods as a defensive trade mark notwithstanding that it is already registered in his name in respect of those goods otherwise than as a defensive trade mark, or may apply for the registration thereof in respect of any goods otherwise than as a defensive trade mark notwithstand┬¼ing that it is already registered in his name in respect of those goods as a defensive trade mark, in lieu in each case of the existing registration.(3) A trade mark registered as a defensive trade mark and that trade mark as otherwise registered in the name of the same proprietor shall, notwithstanding that the respective registrations are in respect of different goods, be deemed to be, and shall be registered as, associated trade marks.(4) On application in the prescribed manner by any person aggrieved to the High Court Division or to the Registrar, the registration of a trade mark as a defensive trade mark may be cancelled on the ground that the requirements of sub section (1) are no longer satisfied in respect of any goods in relation to which the trade mark is registered in the name of the same proprietor otherwise than as a defensive trade mark, or may be cancelled as respects any goods in relation to which it is registered as a defensive trade mark on the ground that there is no longer any likelihood that the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods would be taken as giving the indication mentioned in sub section (1).(5) The Registrar may at any time cancel the registration as a defensive trade mark of a trade mark of which there is no longer any registration in the name of the same proprietor otherwise than as a defensive trade mark.(6) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the provisions of this Act shall apply in respect of the registration of trade marks as defensive trade marks and of trade marks so registered as they apply in other cases.

### Registered users

39. (1) A person other than the proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof in respect of all or any of the goods in respect of which it is registered (otherwise than as a defensive trade mark) and either with or without conditions or restrictions.(2) The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor, for any purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law.

### Power of registered user to take proceedings against infringement

40. (1) Subject to any agreement subsisting between the parties, a registered user of a trade mark shall be entitled to call upon the proprietor thereof to take proceedings to prevent infringement thereof, and if the proprietor refuses or neglects to do so within three months after being so called upon, the registered user may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as if he were the proprietor, making the proprietor a defendant.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, a proprietor so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.

(1) Where it is proposed that a person should be registered as a registered user of a trade mark, the proprietor and the proposed registered user shall make application in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner accompanied by an affidavit made by the proprietor, or by some person authorised to the satisfaction of the Registrar to act on his behalf,-(a) giving particulars of the relationship, existing or proposed, between the proprietor and the proposed regis┬¼tered user, including particulars showing the degree of control by the proprietor over the permitted use which their relationship will confer and whether it is a term of their relationship that the proposed regis┬¼tered user shall be the sole registered user or that there shall be any other restriction as to persons for whose registration as registered users application may be made;(b) stating the goods in respect of which registration is proposed;(c) stating any conditions or restrictions proposed with respect to the characteristics of the goods, to the mode or place of permitted use, or to any other matter;(d) stating whether the permitted use is to be for a period or without limit of period, and, if for a period, the duration thereof;and by such further documents, information or evidence as may be required by the Registrar or as may be prescribed.(2) When the requirements of sub section (1) have been com┬¼plied with, if the Registrar is satisfied that in all the circumstances the use of the trade mark in respect of the proposed goods or any of them by the proposed registered user subject to any conditions or restrictions which the Registrar may think proper, would not be contrary to the public interest, the Registrar may register, subject as aforesaid, the proposed registered user as a registered user in respect of the goods as to which he is so satisfied.(3) The Registrar shall refuse an application under this section if it appears to him that the grant thereof would tend to facilitate trafficking in a trade mark.(4) The Registrar shall, if so requested by an applicant, take steps for securing that information given for the purposes of an application under this section (other than matter entered in the register) is not disclosed to rivals in trade.(5) The Registrar shall issue notice in the prescribed manner┬¼-(a) of the registration of a person as a registered user, to any other registered user of the trade mark;(b) of an application under section 42, to the registered proprietor, and each registered user (not being the applicant) of the trade mark.

### Power to Registrar to vary or cancel registration as registered user

42. Without prejudice to the provisions of section 46, the registration of a person as a registered user-(a) may be varied by the Registrar as regards the goods in respect of which, or any conditions or restrictions subject to which, it has effect, on the application in writing in the prescribed manner of the registered proprietor of the trade mark;(b) may be cancelled by the Registrar on the application in writing in the prescribed manner of the registered proprietor or of the registered user or of any other registered user of the trade mark;(c) may be cancelled by the Registrar on the application in writing in the prescribed manner of any person on any of the following grounds, namely:-(i) that the registered user has used the trade mark otherwise than by way of the permitted use, or in such a way as to cause or to be likely to cause, deception or confusion;(ii) that the proprietor or the registered user misrepresented, or failed to disclose, some fact material to the application for the registration, or that the circumstances have materially changed since the date of the registration;(iii) that the registration ought not to have been effected having regard to rights vested in the applicant by virtue of a contract in the performance of which he is interested;(d) may be cancelled by the Registrar in respect of any goods in relation to which the trade mark is no longer registered.

### Use of one of associated or substantially identical trade marks equivalent to use of another

44.

### Use of trade mark for export trade, and use when form of trade connection changes

45. (1) The application in Bangladesh of a trade mark to goods to be exported from Bangladesh and any other act done in Bangladesh in relation to goods to be so exported which, if done in relation to goods to be sold or otherwise traded in within Bangladesh would constitute use of a trade mark therein, shall be deemed to constitute use of the trade mark in relation to those goods for any purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law.(2) The use of a registered trade mark in relation to goods between which and the person using the mark any form of connection in the course of trade subsists shall not be deemed to be likely to cause deception or confusion on the ground only that the mark has been or is used in relation to goods between which and the person using the mark or any predecessor in his business diffe┬¼rent form of connection in the course of trade subsisted or subsists.

### Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register

46.

### Right conferred by registration

57. [13](1)[\* \* \*] Subject to the provisions of sections 25, 26 and 58, the registration of a person as proprietor of a certification trade mark in respect of any goods shall, give to that person the exclusive right to the use of the certification trade mark in relation to those goods, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the mark or a person authorised by him in that behalf under the regulations deposited under section 56, using it in accordance therewith, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion, in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either┬¼-(a) as being used as a certification trade mark; or(b) to import a reference to some person having the right either as proprietor, or by his authorisation under the said regulations, to use the mark, or to goods certified by the proprietor.(2) [Omitted by section 3 and the Second Schedule of the [Bangladesh Laws (Revision And Declaration) Act, 1973](/act-430.html "Bangladesh Laws (Revision And Declaration) Act, 1973") (Act No. VIII of 1973).]
