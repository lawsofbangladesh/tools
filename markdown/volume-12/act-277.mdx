### Special rules of evidence

7. (1) When any person is charged before a Special Judge with an offence triable under this Act, the fact that such person or any other person through him or on his behalf, is in possession, for which he cannot satisfactorily account, of pecuniary resources, or property disproportionate to his known sources of income, or that such person has, on or about the time of offence with which he is charged, obtained an accretion to his pecuniary resources or property for which he cannot satisfactorily account, may be proved, and may be taken into consideration by the Special Judge as a relevant fact in deciding whether he is guilty of the particular offence with which he is charged.(2) Where in any trial before a Special Judge of an offence punishable under sections 161 to 165 of the [26](1)[Penal Code], it is proved that an accused person has accepted or obtained, or has agreed to accept or attempted to obtain, for himself or for any other person, any gratification (other than legal remuneration) or any valuable thing, or any pecuniary advantage from a person or the agent of a person, for any favour shown or promised to be shown by the accused person, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that he accepted or obtained, or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain, that gratification, or that valuable thing, or pecuniary advantage to himself or some other person, as the case may be, as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in sections 161, 162 and 163 of the [27](2)[Penal Code], or, as the case may be, without consideration, or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate.(3) Where in any trial of an offence punishable under section 165A of the [28](3)[Penal Code], it is proved that any gratification (other than legal remuneration) or any valuable thing has been given or offered to be given or attempted to be given by an accused person, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he gave or offered to give or attempted to give the gratification or valuable thing, as the case may be, as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in section 161 of the said Code or, as the case may be, without consideration or for a consideration which he knew to be inadequate.(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), the Court may decline to draw the presumption referred to in either of the said sub-sections, if the gratification or thing aforesaid is, in its opinion, so trivial that no inference of corruption may fairly be drawn.

### Bar on trial de novo

8. A Special Judge, unless he otherwise decides, shall not be bound to recall or rehear any witness, whose evidence has already been recorded, or to re-open proceedings already held, but may act on the evidence already produced or recorded and continue the trial from the stage which the case has reached.

### Punishment of offences

9. When any person charged before a Special Judge with an offence triable under this Act is found guilty of the offence the Special Judge shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, whether or not he imposes a sentence of imprisonment, impose a sentence of fine which shall not be less than the gain found to have been derived by the accused by the [29](1)[commission of the offence and may also order confiscation of the whole or any part of the property of the accused to the Government].

### Appeal, revision and transfer of cases

10. [30](1)[(1) An appeal from the judgement of a Special Judge shall lie to-(a) the High Court Division, if the Special Judge is or has been a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge;[31](2)[\* \* \*](1A) The Court to which an appeal lies under sub-section (1) shall also have powers of revisions.](2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 417 of the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898](/act-75.html "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898"), in any case tried by a Special Judge appointed by the Government under section 3, in which such Special Judge has passed an order of acquittal, [32](3)[the Commission may] direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to such Court as aforesaid.(3) The [33](4)[High Court Division] shall have authority to transfer any case from the Court of a Special Judge to the Court of another Special Judge:Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in section 526 of the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898](/act-75.html "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898"), the Special Judge from whose Court a transfer is desired, shall not be bound to adjourn the case, but if he rejects a request for adjournment, he shall record his reasons for doing so.(4) No prosecution under this Act against any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is being tried shall be withdrawn except under the orders in writing of the [34](5)[Commission].

### Bail and imprisonment

11. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Second Schedule to the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898](/act-75.html "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898"), or any other law for the time being in force, offences triable by a Special Judge under this Act shall be deemed to be non-bailable.(2) Any offence triable under this Act which is punishable with simple imprisonment shall be deemed to be punishable with imprisonment of either description.

### Power to make rules

(1) The Government may frame rules to carry out the purposes of this Act.(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers, such rules may provide for any of the following matters, namely:-[35](1)[\* \* \*](b) the emoluments of the Special Judges, and their appointment;(c) territorial limits of the jurisdiction of Special Judges and the place and time of sitting of the Courts presided over by the Special Judges;(d) the summoning of witnesses and compelling the production of documents and the penalty for disobeying, or evading the same, in addition to or substitution of the provisions of the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898](/act-75.html "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898");(e) matters incidental to the above.
