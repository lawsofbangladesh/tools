### Conditional discharges, etc.

4. (1) Where a Court by which a person, not proved to have been previously convicted, is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for not more than two years is of opinion, having regard to:-(a) the age, character, antecedents or physical or mental condition of the offender, and(b) the nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances attending the commission of the offence,that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate, the court may, after recording its reasons in writing, make an order discharging him after its admonition, or, if the court thinks fit, it may likewise make an order discharging him subject to the condition that he enters into a bond, with or without sureties, for committing no offence and being of good behaviour during such period not exceeding one year from the date of the order as may be specified therein.(2) An order discharging a person subject to such condition as aforesaid is hereafter in this Ordinance referred to as “an order for conditional discharge”, and the period specified in any such order as “the period of conditional discharge”.(3) Before making an order for conditional discharge, the court shall explain to the offender in ordinary language that if he commits any offence or does not remain of good behaviour during the period of conditional discharge he will be liable to be sentenced for the original offence.(4) Where a person conditionally discharged under this section is sentenced for the offence in respect of which the order for conditional discharge was made, that order shall cease to have effect.

### Order for payment of costs and compensation

6. (1) A court directing the discharge of an offender under section 4 or making a probation order under section 5 may order the offender to pay such compensation or damages for loss or injury caused to any person by the offence and such costs of the proceedings as the court thinks reasonable:Provided that the amount of compensation, damages and costs so awarded shall in no case exceed the amount of fine which the court might have imposed in respect of the offence.(2) At the time of awarding compensation or damages in any subsequent civil suit or proceeding relating to the same offence, the court hearing such suit or proceeding shall take into account any sum paid or recovered as compensation, damages or costs under sub-section (1).(3) The amount ordered to be paid under sub-section (1) may be recovered as fine in accordance with the provisions of section 386 and 387 of the Code.

### Failure to observe conditions of the bond

7. (1) If the court by which an offender is bound by a bond under section 5 has reason to believe that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his bond, it may issue a warrant for his arrest or may, if it thinks fit, issue summons to the offender and his sureties, if any, requiring them to appear before it at such time as may be specified in the summons.(2) The court before which an offender is brought or appears under sub-section (1) may either remand him to judicial custody until the case is heard or admit him to bail, with or without sureties, to appear on the date of hearing.(3) If the court, after hearing the case, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his bond, including any conditions which may have been imposed under sub-section (2) of section 5, it may forthwith-(a) sentence him for the original offence, or(b) without prejudice to the continuance in force of the bond, impose upon him a fine not exceeding one thousand [7](1)[taka]:Provided that the court imposing the fine shall take into account the amount of compensation, damages or costs ordered to be paid under section 6.(4) If a fine imposed under clause (b) of sub-section (3) is not paid within such period as the court may fix, the court may sentence the offender for the original offence.

### Powers of court in appeal and revision

8. Where an appeal or application for revision is made against conviction of an offence for which an order is made under section 4 or section 5 discharging the offender absolutely or conditionally or placing him on probation the appellate court or the court sitting in revision may pass such order as it could have passed under the Code, or may set aside or amend the order made under section 4 or section 5 and in lieu thereof pass sentence authorised by law:Provided that the appellate court or the court sitting in revision shall not impose a greater punishment than the punishment which might have been imposed by the court by which the offender was convicted.

### Provisions of the Code to apply to sureties and bond

9. The provisions of sections 122, 406A, 514, 514A, 514B and 515 of the Code shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of sureties and bonds taken under this Ordinance.

### Variation of conditions of probation

10. (1) The court by which a probation order is made under section 5 may at any time, on the application of the person under probation or of the probation officer or of its own motion, if it thinks it expedient to vary the bond taken under that section, summon the person under probation to appear before it, and, after giving him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why the bond should not be varied, vary the bond by extending or reducing the duration thereof or by altering any other of its terms and conditions or by inserting additional conditions therein:Provided that in no case shall the duration of the bond be less than one year or more than three years from the date of the original order:Provided further that where the bond is with surety or sureties, no variation shall be made in the bond without the consent of the surety or sureties; and if the surety or sureties do not consent to the variation, the court shall require the person under probation to execute a fresh bond, with or without sureties.(2) Any such court as aforesaid may, on the application of any person under probation or of the probation officer or of its own motion, if satisfied that the conduct of the person under probation has been satisfactory as to render it unnecessary to keep him under supervision, discharge the probation order and the bond.

### Effects of discharge and probation

11. (1) A conviction of an offence, for which an order is made under section 4 or section 5 for discharging the offender after the due admonition or conditionally or placing him on probation, shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the provisions of this Ordinance:Provided that where an offender, being not less than eighteen years of age at the time of his conviction of an offence for which an order discharging him conditionally or placing him on probation is made, is subsequently sentenced under this Ordinance for that offence, the provisions of this sub-section shall cease to apply to the conviction.(2) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this section, the conviction of an offender who is discharged after due admonition or conditionally, or who is placed on probation, shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any law which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability.(3) The foregoing provisions of this section shall not affect-(a) any right of any such offender to appeal against his conviction, or to rely thereon in bar of any subsequent proceedings for the same offence;(b) the revesting or restoration of any property in consequence of the conviction of any such offender.

### Appointment of probation officers
