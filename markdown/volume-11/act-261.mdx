### Cognizance of cases by Tribunal

7. (1) The Tribunal shall take cognizance of a case only when an information in respect of a specified person is laid before it by a police officer of the area concerned, not below the rank of an Inspector of Police [8](1)[or Sub-Inspector of Police in charge of Police Station] who has taken part in the investigation of the case. The information shall be signed by the officer concerned and shall briefly set out-(a) the practices with which the person complained of is charged;(b) instances, with details of time and place, of such practices;(c) a statement of any relevant general reputation in which the said person is held and any other ground on which the information is based;(d) names and other particulars of witnesses who will be produced to support the allegations contained in the information; and(e) whether the said person is sought to be declared a goonda or a dangerous goonda.(2) The officer laying the information may, if he thinks fit, enclose any of the above particulars in a sealed cover and request that the same be kept secret and the Tribunal shall order that such particulars shall not be disclosed at any stage of the enquiry, and that when the said particulars fall under clause (d) of sub-section (1) the name of the witness shall not be disclosed until such time as such witness is produced in evidence:Provided that if the said officer or the person conducting the prosecution before the Tribunal desires that the name of any witness may not be disclosed at all, the Tribunal shall order accordingly.

### Summoning of the person complained of

8. On receipt of an information under section 7, the Tribunal shall summon the person complained of to appear before it and shall at the same time supply him with a copy of such portion of the information as is not to be kept secret under the provisions of the preceding section:Provided that when the Tribunal is satisfied that such action is necessary, it may, in the very first instance or at any later stage of the enquiry, instead of issuing a summons or notice issue a warrant, non-bailable or bailable in such sum as may appear to it reasonable, for the arrest of the aforesaid person and his production before the Tribunal and may also issue such warrant if satisfied that the said person is hiding himself to evade service of the summons or if he does not appear in spite of the service of the summons.

### Appearance before Tribunal

9. (1) When the person complained of appears before it, the Tribunal may take a bond from him with or without sureties for his appearance during the enquiry or when called upon, as the case may be, and may also having regard to the nature of the information laid against him, require him to furnish a bond, with one or more sureties, in such sum as the Tribunal may think fit, to be of good behaviour until the conclusion of the enquiry, and may direct that he may be detained in custody until such bond is executed, or in default of execution, until the enquiry is concluded.(2) The Tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded, instead of taking a bond for the appearance of the person complained of, order his detention in such custody as may be prescribed by the Government by a general or special order till the conclusion of the enquiry by it.

### Proceedings before Tribunal

10. The Tribunal shall then proceed to enquire into the truth or otherwise of the information upon which action has been taken, and for that purpose to take such evidence as may appear necessary, following in all cases the procedure prescribed in the [Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898](/act-75.html "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898") for conducting trials and recording evidence in summary cases, but subject to the other provisions of this Act.

### No de novo proceedings

11. It shall not be necessary for the Tribunal to record the evidence of any witness de novo by reason only of a change in its own composition, but the Tribunal may at any time summon and examine any person, who in its opinion, is capable of giving information relevant to any matter under enquiry notwithstanding that such person has already given evidence in such enquiry.

### Joint proceedings

12. Where two or more persons are associated together with regard to any matter covered by the allegations contained in the information respectively laid in respect of each, to an extent which in the opinion of the Tribunal justifies such a course, the enquiry into the matter with regard to which they are associated together may be conducted against all or any of them jointly, or against each of them separately, as the Tribunal shall think just.

### Declaration of goondas and dangerous goondas

13. (1) If the Tribunal is satisfied, as a result of enquiry held under this Act, that the person complained against-(i) frequents for immoral purposes houses or localities inhabited by prostitutes; or(ii) frequents resorts of vice such as drinking or gambling dens, or places where opium or other intoxicating drugs are smoked or otherwise consumed; or(iii) generally appears in public while drunk; or(iv) is addicted to smoking opium; or(v) uses obscene or abusive language in public; or(vi) makes fraudulent collection in the name of charity;(vii) is involved in affray, rowdism or acts of intimidation or violence in any place private or public so as to cause alarm to the people living or frequenting the neighbourhood;it shall declare that such person is a goonda and direct that his name be publicly notified in the prescribed manner, and placed on the prescribed list of goondas.(2) If the Tribunal is satisfied, as a result of enquiry as aforesaid, that any person complained against-(i) having previously been declared a goonda has since such declaration acted in any manner specified in the preceding sub-section, or has contravened any prohibitory order published under section 15 made in respect of him by the Tribunal; or(ii) corrupts young persons, by initiating them in the practice of any vice which if established against any person to the satisfaction of the Tribunal would entail his being declared a goonda or a dangerous goonda under this section; or(iii) annoys or molests other persons, particularly women or young persons; or(iv) publishes, distributes, circulates, sells or offers for sale an obscene book or picture or other objects; or(v) does obscene acts including wilfully exposing his person in public; or(vi) insults the modesty of women by using foul language or making indecent sounds or gestures, or by exposure of his person or the person of any other individual or of any object or otherwise howsoever; or(vii) engages in kidnapping or seducing women or young persons or procuring women or young persons for immoral purposes; or(viii) indulges in unnatural carnal intercourse; or(ix) keeps a drinking or gambling den, or place where opium or other intoxicating drugs are smoked or otherwise consumed, or makes livelihood out of such den or place by acting as a tout or otherwise howsoever, or engages in the illicit manufacture or sale of liquor or opium or other intoxicating drugs; or(x) behaves riotously in public by entering into affrays, or otherwise howsoever; or(xi) causes fear or alarm to the public or any section or member thereof, by issuing threats verbally or in writing, or by making, publishing or circulating false statements, rumours or reports; or(xii) is a bully, who assaults or threatens persons with the object of causing fear or alarm, or to compel them to act or not to act in a manner in which they are not bound to act, or as the case may be are entitled to act; or(xiii) makes livelihood, or extorts money or other property, or seeks any concession or favour from any one, by any form of intimidation; or(xiv) utters counterfeit coins; or(xv) is by habit a smuggler of goods through customs or octroi or other tax barriers, without payment of the requisite duty or tax or in contravention of a lawful order prohibiting the export or import across such barriers; or(xvi) is by habit a forger; or(xvii) makes a livelihood out of, or otherwise practices whether by himself or in association with other persons, the receiving or disposal of stolen property; or(xviii) makes a livelihood by cheating, fraud, black marketing (that is to say, engaging in transactions involving the transfer, sale or movement of goods in contravention of any lawful order controlling such transfer, sale or movement), acting as an intermediary between bribe givers and corrupt officials or persons in public life, or by any other corrupt or dishonest means;it shall declare that such person is a dangerous goonda, and shall direct that his name be publicly notified in the prescribed manner, and be placed on the prescribed list of dangerous goondas.
