# 101

This repository contains everything about how I scraped the site and how I formatted it. This repository exists for archival purposes and to help anyone who wants to scrape the site in the future.

# Contribute

The site is not mature yet as there are many typos, things to manually check, and so on. If you want to contribute, see this [contribution](https://laws.sayed.app/contribute) page. A detailed guideline is available there.

## Acknowledgements

The whole process of scraping and formatting was done with the help of many AI models: Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude.
