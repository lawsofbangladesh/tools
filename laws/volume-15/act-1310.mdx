## Preamble

Whereas certain persons, individually or as members of organisations, directly or indirectly, have been collaborators of the Pakistan Armed forces, which had illegally occupied Bangladesh by brute force, and have aided or abetted the Pakistan Armed forces of occupation in committing genocide and crimes against humanity and in committing atrocities against men, women, and children and against the person, property and honour of the civilian population of Bangladesh and have otherwise aided or co-operated with or acted in the interest of the Pakistan Armed forces of occupation or contributed by any act, word or sign towards maintaining, sustaining, strengthening, supporting or furthering the illegal occupation of Bangladesh by the Pakistan Armed forces or have waged war or aided or abetted in waging war against the People's Republic of Bangladesh;

And whereas such collaboration contributed towards the perpetration of a reign of terror and the commission of crimes against humanity on a scale which has horrified the moral consciences of the people of Bangladesh and of right-thinking people through the world;

And whereas it is imperative that such persons should be dealt with effectively and be adequately punished in accordance with the due process of law;

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the setting up of Special Tribunals for expeditious and fair trial of the offences committed by such persons;

Now therefore, in pursuance of the Proclamation of Independence of Bangladesh, reads with the Provisional Constitution of Bangladesh Order, 1972 and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President is, pleased to make the following Order :
