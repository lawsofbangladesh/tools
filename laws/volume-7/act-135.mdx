### Power of Collector to intervence in case of unrepresented soldier

5. If any Collector has reason to believe that any soldier, who ordinarily resides or has property in his district and who is a party to any proceeding pending before any Court, is unable to appear therein, the Collector may certify the facts in the prescribed manner to the Court.

### Notice to be given in case of unrepresented soldier

6.(1) If a Collector has certified under section 5, or if the Court has reason to believe, that a soldier, who is a party to any proceeding pending before it, is unable to appear therein, and if the soldier is not represented by any person duly authorised to appear, plead or act on his behalf, the Court shall suspend the proceeding and shall give notice thereof in the prescribed manner to the prescribed authority:Provided that the Court may refrain from suspending the proceeding and issuing the notice if-(a) the proceeding is a suit, appeal or application instituted or made by the soldier, alone or conjointly with others with the object of enforcing a right of preemption, or(b) the interests of the soldier in the proceeding are, in the opinion of the Court, either identical with those of any other party to the proceeding and adequately represented by such other party or merely of a formal nature.(2) If it appears to the Court before which any proceeding is pending that a soldier though not a party to the proceeding is materially concerned in the outcome of the proceeding, and that his interests are likely to be prejudiced by his inability to attend, the Court may suspend the proceeding and shall give notice thereof in the prescribed manner to the prescribed authority.

### Postponement of proceedings

7. If, on receipt of a notice under section 6, the prescribed authority certifies in the prescribed manner to the Court in which the proceeding is pending that the soldier in respect of whom the notice was given is serving under special conditions, and that a postponement of the proceeding in respect of the soldier is necessary in the interests of justice, the Court shall thereupon postpone the proceeding in respect of the soldier for the prescribed period, or, if no period has been prescribed, for such period as it thinks fit.

### Court may proceed when no certificate received

8. If, after issue of a notice under section 6, the prescribed authority either certifies that the soldier is not serving under special conditions or that such postponement is not necessary, or fails to certify, in the case of a soldier resident in the district in which the Court is situate, within two months or, in any other case, within three months from the date of the issue of the notice that such postponement is necessary, the Court may, if it thinks fit, continue the proceeding.

### Postponement of proceedings against soldier on leave

9. When any document purporting to be signed by the Commanding Officer of a soldier who is a party to any proceeding is produced by or on behalf of the soldier before the Court in which the proceeding is pending and is to the effect that the soldier-(a) is on leave of absence for a period not exceeding two months, and is on the expiration of his leave to proceed on service under special conditions, or(b) is on sick leave for a period not exceeding three months, and is on the expiration of his leave to rejoin his unit with a view to proceeding on service under special conditions,the proceeding in respect of such soldier may, in any case such as is referred to in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 6 and shall, in any other case, be postponed in the manner provided in section 7.

### Power to set aside decrees and orders passed against a soldier serving under war or special conditions

10.(1) In any proceeding before a Court in which a decree or order has been passed against any soldier whilst he was serving under any special conditions, the soldier or, if he is dead, his legal representative may apply to the Court which passed the decree or order for an order to set aside the same, and, if the Court, after giving an opportunity to the opposite party of being heard, is satisfied that the interests of justice require that the decree or order should be set aside as against the soldier, the Court shall, subject to such conditions, if any, as it thinks fit to impose, make an order accordingly.(2) The period of limitation for an application under sub-section (1) shall be ninety days from the date of the decree or order, or, where the summons or notice was not duly served on the soldier in the proceeding in which the decree or order was passed, from the date on which the applicant had knowledge of the decree or order; and the provisions of section 5 or the [Limitation Act, 1908](/act-88.html "Limitation Act, 1908"), shall apply to such applications.(3) When the decree or order in respect of which an application under sub-section (1) is made is of such a nature that it cannot be set aside as against the soldier only, it may be set aside as against all or any of the parties against whom it has been made.(4) Where a Court sets aside a decree or order under this section, it shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be.

### Modification of law of limitation where soldier or his legal representative is a party

11. In computing the period of limitation prescribed by sub-section (2) of section 10 of this Act, the [Limitation Act, 1908](/act-88.html "Limitation Act, 1908") or any other law for the time being in force, for any suit, appeal or application to a Court, any party to which is or has been a soldier, or is the legal representative of a soldier, the period during which the soldier has been serving under any special conditions, and, if the soldier has died while so serving, the period from the date of his death to the date on which official intimation thereof was sent to his next-of-kin by the authorities in Bangladesh, shall be excluded:Provided that this section shall not apply in the case of any suit, appeal or application instituted or made with the object of enforcing a right of pre-emption except where the said right accrues in such circumstances, and is in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property situated in any such area, as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf.

### Power of Court to refer questions to prescribed authorities

12. If any Court is in doubt whether, for the purposes of section 10 or section 11, a soldier is or was at any particular time serving under special conditions, or has died while so serving or as to the date of such death or as to the date on which official intimation of such death was sent to his next-of-kin by the authorities in Bangladesh, the Court may refer the point for the decision of the prescribed authority, and the certificate of that authority shall be conclusive evidence on the point.
