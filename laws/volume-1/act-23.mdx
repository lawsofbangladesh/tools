### Bar of suits relating to pensions

4. Except as hereinafter provided, no Civil Court shall entertain any suit relating to any pension or grant of money or land-revenue conferred or made by the Government or any former Government, whatever may have been the consideration for any such pension or grant, and whatever may have been the nature of the payment, claim or right for which such pension or grant may have been substituted.

### Claims to be made to Collector or other authorized officer

5. Any person having a claim relating to any such pension or grant may prefer such claim to the Collector of the District or Deputy Commissioner or other officer authorized in this behalf by the Government; and such Collector, Deputy Commissioner or other officer shall dispose of such claim in accordance with such rules as the Chief Revenue-authority may, subject to the general control of the Government, from time to time prescribe in this behalf.

### Civil Court empowered to take cognizance of such claims

6. A Civil Court, otherwise competent to try the same, shall take cognizance of any such claim upon receiving a certificate from such Collector, Deputy Commissioner or other officer authorized in that behalf that the case may be so tried, but shall not make any order or decree in any suit whatever by which the liability of Government to pay any such pension or grant as aforesaid is affected directly or indirectly.

### Pensions for lands held under grants in perpetuity

7. Nothing in sections 4 and 6 applies to-pensions heretofore granted by Government in the territories subject to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, either wholly or in part as an indemnity for loss sustained by the resumption by a Native Government of lands held under sanads purporting to confer a right in perpetuity. Such pensions shall not be liable to resumption on the death of the recipient, but every such pension shall be capable of alienation and descent, and may be sued for and recovered in the same manner as any other property.

### Payment to be made by Collector or other authorized officer

8. All pensions or grants by Government of money or land-revenue shall be paid by the Collector or the Deputy Commissioner or other authorized officer, subject to such rules as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the Chief Controlling Revenue-authority.

### Saving of rights of grantees of land-revenue

9. Nothing in sections 4 and 8 shall affect the right of a grantee of land-revenue, whose claim to such grant is admitted by Government, to recover such revenue from the persons liable to pay the same under any law for the time being in force for the recovery of the rent of land.

### Commutation of pensions

10. The Government may, with the consent of the holder, order the whole or any part of his pension or grant of money or land-revenue to be commuted for a lump sum on such terms as may seem fit.

### Exemption of pension from attachment

11. No pension granted or continued by Government on political considerations, or on account of past services or present infirmities or as a compassionate allowance,and no money due or to become due on account of any such pension or allowance,shall be liable to seizure, attachment or sequestration by process of any Court in Bangladesh, at the instance of a creditor, for any demand against the pensioner, or in satisfaction of a decree or order of any such Court.This section applies in Bangladesh also to pensions granted or continued, after the separation of Burma from India, by the Government of Burma.

### Assignments, etc., in anticipation of pension, to be void

12. All assignments, agreements, orders, sales and securities of every kind made by the person entitled to any pension, pay or allowance mentioned in section 11, in respect of any money not payable at or before the making thereof, on account of any such pension, pay or allowance, or for giving or assigning any future interest therein, are null and void.
