### Imposition of countervailing duty

[72](1)[18A. (1) Where any country or territory pays, bestows, directly or indirectly, any subsidy upon the manufacture or production therein or the exportation therefrom of any goods including any subsidy on transportation of such goods, then, upon the importation of any such goods into Bangladesh, whether the same is imported directly from the country of manufacture, production or otherwise, and whether it is imported in the same condition as when exported from the country of manufacture or production or has been changed in condition by manufacture, production or otherwise, the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, impose a countervailing duty not exceeding the amount of such subsidy.

Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, subsidy shall be deemed to exist, if-

(a) there is financial contribution by a Government, or any public body within the territory of the exporting or producing country, that is, where-

(i) a Government practice involves a direct transfer of funds (including grants, loans and equity infusion) or potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities or both;

(ii) Government revenue that is otherwise due is forgone or not collected (including fiscal incentives);

(iii) a Government provides goods or services other than general infrastructure or purchases goods;

(iv) a Government makes payments to funding mechanism, or entrusts or directs a private body to carry out one or more of the type of functions specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) which would normally be vested in the Government and the practice, in no real sense, differs from practices normally followed by Governments; or

(b) a Government grants or maintains any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly to increase export of any goods from, or to reduce import of any goods to its territory, and a benefit is thereby conferred.

(2) The Government may, pending the determination of the amount of subsidy, in accordance with the provisions of this section and the rules made thereunder impose a countervailing duty under this sub-section not exceeding the amount of such subsidy as provisionally estimated by it and if such countervailing duty exceeds the subsidy as so determined,-

(a) the Government shall, having regard to such determination and as soon as may be after such determination reduce such countervailing duty; and

(b) refund shall be made of so much of such countervailing duty which has been collected as is in excess of the countervailing duty as so reduced.

(3) Subject to any rules made by the Government, by notification in the official Gazette, the countervailing duty under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall not be levied unless it is determined that-

(a) the subsidy relates to export performance;

(b) the subsidy relates to the use of domestic raw materials over imported raw materials in the exported goods; or

(c) the subsidy has been conferred on a limited number of persons engaged in manufacturing, producing or exporting the goods unless such a subsidy is for-

(i) research activities conducted by or on behalf of persons engaged in the manufacture, production or export; or

(ii) assistance to disadvantaged regions within the territory of the exporting country; or

(iii) assistance to promote adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements.

(4) If the Government, is of the opinion that the injury to the domestic industry which is difficult to repair, is caused by massive imports in a relatively short period, of the goods benefiting from subsidies paid or bestowed and where in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury, it is necessary to levy countervailing duty retrospectively, the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, impose countervailing duty from a date prior to the date of imposition of countervailing duty under sub-section (2) but not beyond ninety days from the date of notification under that sub-section and notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, such duty shall be payable from the date as specified in the notification issued under this sub-section.

(5) The countervailing duty chargeable under this section shall be in addition to any other duty imposed under this Act or any other law for the time being in force.

(6) The countervailing duty imposed under this section shall unless revoked earlier, cease to have effect on the expiry of five years from the date of such imposition:

Provided that if the Government, in a review, is of the opinion that the cessation of such duty is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and injury, it may, from time to time, extend the period of such imposition for a further period of five years and such further period shall commence from the date of order of such extension:

Provided further that where a review initiated before the expiry of the aforesaid period of five years has not come to a conclusion before such expiry, the countervailing duty may continue to remain in force pending outcome of such a review for a further period not exceeding one year.

(7) The amount of any subsidy referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall, from time to time, be ascertained and determined by the Government, after such inquiry as it may consider necessary and the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for the identification of such goods and for the assessment and collection of any countervailing duty imposed upon the importation thereof under this section.

(8) No proceeding for imposition of countervailing duty under this section shall commence unless the Bangladesh Tariff Commission, on receipt of a written application by or on behalf of a domestic industry, informs the Government that there is prima-facie evidence of injury which is caused by direct or indirect subsidy on any particular imported goods.

### Imposition of anti-dumping duty

18B. (1) Where any goods are exported from any country or territory (hereinafter in this section referred to as the exporting country or territory) to Bangladesh at less than the normal value, then, upon the importation of such goods into Bangladesh, the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, impose an anti-dumping duty not exceeding the margin of dumping in relation to such goods.

Explanation.- For the purposes of this section,-

(a) “margin of dumping”, in relation to any goods, means the difference between its export price and its normal value;

(b) “export price”, in relation to any goods, means the price of the goods exported from the exporting country or territory and in cases where there is no export price or where the export price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement between the exporter and the importer or a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported goods are first resold to an independent buyer, or if the goods are not resold to an independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such reasonable basis as may be determined in accordance with the rules made under sub-section (6);

(c) “normal value”, in relation to any goods, means-

(i) the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like goods when meant for consumption in the exporting country or territory as determined in accordance with the rules made under sub-section (6); or

(ii) when there are no sales of the like goods in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or territory, or, when because of the particular market situation or low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country or territory, such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the normal value shall be either-

(a) comparable representative price of the like goods when exported from the exporting country or territory or an appropriate third country as determined in accordance with the rules made under sub-section (6); or

(b) the cost of production of the said goods in the country of origin along with reasonable addition for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits, as determined in accordance with the rules made under sub-section (6):

Provided that in the case of import of the goods from a country other than the country of origin and where the goods have been merely transhipped through the country of export or such goods are not produced in the country of export, or there is no comparable price in the country of export, the normal value shall be determined with reference to the price in country of origin.

(2) The Government may, pending the determination of the normal value and the margin of dumping in relation to any goods, in accordance with the provisions of this section and the rules made thereunder, impose on the importation of such goods into Bangladesh an anti-dumping duty on the basis of a provisional estimate of such value and margin and if such anti-dumping duty exceeds the margin as so determined-

(a) the Government shall, having regard to such determination and as soon as may be after such determination, reduce such anti-dumping duty; and

(b) refund shall be made of so much of the anti-dumping duty which has been collected as is in excess of anti-dumping duty as so reduced.

(3) if the Government, in respect of the dumped goods under inquiry, is of the opinion that-

(i) there is a history of dumping which caused injury or that the importer was, or should have been, aware that the exporter practices dumping and that such dumping cause injury; and

(ii) the injury is caused by massive dumping of goods imported in a relatively short time which in light of the timing and the volume of imported goods dumped and other circumstances, is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the anti-dumping duty liable to be levied, the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, levy anti-dumping duty retrospectively from a date prior to the date of imposition of anti-dumping duty under sub-section (2) but not beyond ninety days from the date of notification under that sub-section and notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, such duty shall be payable at such rate and from such date as may be specified in the notification.

(4) The anti-dumping duty chargeable under this section shall be in addition to any other duty imposed under this Act or any other law for the time being in force.

(5) The anti-dumping duty imposed under this section shall, unless revoked earlier, cease to have effect on the expiry of five years from the date of such imposition:
