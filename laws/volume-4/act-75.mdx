### (206-220) Omitted

[Omitted by section 2 and Schedule of the [Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978](/act-579.html "Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978") (Ordinance No. XLIX of 1978).]

### Charge to state offence

221.(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the accused is charged.

### Specific name of offence sufficient description

(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.

### How stated where offence has no specific name

(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be mentioned in the charge.

### What implied in charge

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.

### Language of charge

(6) The charge shall be written either in English or in the language of the Court.

### Previous conviction when to be set out

(7) If the accused having been previously convicted of any offence is liable, by reason of such previous conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. If such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.Illustrations(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder given in sections 299 and 300 of the Penal Code; that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions of the same Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the three provisions to that exception apply to it.(b) A is charged, under section 326 of the Penal Code with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 of the Penal Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it.(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or that he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definitions of those crimes contained in the Penal Code; but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance, be referred to in the charge.(d) A is charged, under section 184 of the Penal Code with intentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.

### Particulars as to time, place and person

222.(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section 234:

### When manner of committing offence must be stated

223. When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in sections 221 and 222 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.Illustrations(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in which the theft was effected.(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B.(c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false.(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions.(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which A murdered B.(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the disobedience charged and the law infringed.

### Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable

224. In every charge words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them respectively by the law under which such offence is punishable.

### Effect of errors

225. No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.Illustrations(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Penal Code, with "having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit," the word "fraudulently" being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material.(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge, or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haider Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haider Baksh. The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.

### Omitted

226. [Omitted by section 2 and Schedule of the [Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978](/act-579.html "Law Reforms Ordinance, 1978") (Ordinance No. XLIX of 1978).]

### Court may alter charge

227.(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced [278](1)[\* \* \*].(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.

### When trial may proceed immediately after alteration

228. If the charge framed or alteration or addition made under [279](1)[\* \* \*] section 227 is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such charge or alteration or addition has been framed or made proceed with the trial as if the new or altered charged had been the original charge.

### When new trial may be directed, or trial suspended

229. If the new or altered or added charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.

### Stay of proceedings if prosecution of offence in altered charge require previous sanction

230. If the offence stated in the new or altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the new or altered charge is founded.

### Recall of witnesses when charge altered

231. Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed to re-call or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined and also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.

### Effect of material error

232.(1) If any Appellate Court, or the High Court Division in the exercise of its powers of revision or of its powers under Chapter XXVII, is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge, it shall direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit.(2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.

Illustration

A is convicted of an offence, under section 196 of the Penal Code, upon a charge which omits to state that he knew the evidence, which he corruptly used or attempted to use as true or genuine, was false or fabricated. If the Court thinks it probable that A had such knowledge, and that he was misled in his defence by the omission from the charge of the statement that he had it, it shall direct a new trial upon an amended charge; but, if it appears probable from the proceedings that A had no such knowledge, it shall quash the conviction.

### Separate charges for distinct offences

233. For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases mentioned in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239.IllustrationA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion.

### Procedure where accused does not understand proceedings

341. If the accused, though not insane, cannot be made to understand the proceedings, the Court may proceed with the inquiry or trial; and, in the case of a Court other than High Court Division, if such [342](1)[proceedings result] in a conviction, the proceedings shall be forwarded to the High Court Division with a report of the circumstances of the case, and the High Court Division shall pass thereon such order as it thinks fit.

### Power to examine the accused

342.(1) For the purpose of enabling the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers necessary, and shall, for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally on the case after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence.(2) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or by giving false answers to them; but the Court [343](1)[\* \* \*] may draw such inference from such refusal or answers as it thinks just.(3) The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to show he has committed.(4) No oath shall be administered to the accused.

### No influence to be used to induce disclosures
